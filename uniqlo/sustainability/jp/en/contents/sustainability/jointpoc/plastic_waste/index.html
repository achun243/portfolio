              Ocean garbage is a general term encompassing drifting garbage that has washed up on the coast or is floating in the ocean, and seabed garbage that has sunk to the bottom of the sea. Ocean garbage includes not only tools of the sea, such as fishing lines and nets, but also many other items used in our daily lives, such as plastic bottles and plastic bags. Did you know that 80% of ocean garbage comes from the cities we live in? As much as 11 million tons of plastic waste that cannot completely decompose once it has been washed into the sea flows into our oceans every year. As a result, 60-90% of ocean garbage includes various forms of plastic.

              We talk about plastic in general but there are many different types of plastic materials. For instance, synthetic fibers such as polyester and nylon are a type of plastic made from petroleum. PET bottles are perhaps the most well-known items of ocean garbage. However, we can use these bottles to make clothes if we can separate them very carefully and recycle them. We can even reduce the total amount of plastic waste itself by utilizing used plastic as a resource instead of new raw plastic materials.

              Microplastics is a general term that refers to plastic pieces, particles, or fibers of less than 5mm in diameter. Most microplastics come from trash discarded in our towns or at the seaside, but microplastics also find their way into the seas from other, less obvious sources. One of those is our clothing. Very fine fibers flow into the water when we wash clothes made from synthetic fibers and linen. We now know that these fibers accumulate in the sea and other parts of our natural world. They are commonly referred to as microfibers. There are things we can do in our daily lives to reduce microfibers.

            <p class="discourse">
              The ultimate aim is to minimize the impact of microfibers on the natural environment. The Microfibre Consortium was launched to help develop solutions across the whole apparel industry. Research has begun to create solutions that transcend national and corporate boundaries, and to encourage the application of academic research results to textile production processes, with a commitment to a future in which the release of microfibers into the natural environment is properly managed. Specific solutions are being provided to individual brands, retailers, and suppliers to protect ecosystems.<br>UNIQLO joined the Microfibre Consortium in September 2019. We cooperate with the consortium’s research by providing data and fulfilling other tasks, signing the Microfibre 2030 Commitment to work towards zero impact from microfibers on the natural environment by 2030. UNIQLO is also a member of the Japan Clean Ocean Material Alliance (CLOMA). We are researching how to care for and wash clothes together with major washing detergent manufacturers.

                Putting clothes in a laundry net when you wash them can reduce friction and help clothes last longer. Laundry nets have also been found to be effective in reducing the emission of microfibers. (Source: The United States Environmental Protection Agency (EPA))

                Drum-type washing machines rank highly in terms of water-saving performance and are thought to be more effective at preventing the extraction and release of microfibers. Some research suggests drum-type washing machines can reduce microfiber emissions by roughly 70%. (Source: The United States Environmental Protection Agency (EPA))

                </div>
                Do you wash your clothes more often than you need to? While you might want to wash T-shirts and innerwear more frequently, you can reduce the number of microfibers you generate by simply reducing the number of times you wash clothes that don’t come into direct contact with your skin from every time to every other time.
