            <div class="join_ul_cover_img img_addBorder">
              <img src="/jp/ja/contents/sustainability/jointpoc/less_plastic_life/img/main_img.jpg" alt="Getting started is...simple and fun! We talked with two people from the popular website Less Plastic Life to get hints about how to use less plastic.">
            </div>

            <h2 class="join_ul_h2">
              So simple anyone can do it,<br>without impacting the family finances.<br>It’s easy to enjoy “<i>Less Plastic Life</i>”.
            </h2>

            <h3 class="join_ul_h3 color_green">What prompted you to start “<i>Less Plastic Life</i>”?</h3>
            <p class="discourse">
              <span class="person">Koga</span>Until 2017, plastic problems weren’t even on my radar. I’d use plastic bags like it was nothing. But once Nakajima taught me all about plastic pollution, I started making changes to do my part by reducing my own plastic consumption. It turned out to be a lot of fun. I was hooked!<br>
              <span class="person">Nakajima</span>The most effective solution of all is to use less disposable plastic. We started “<i>Less Plastic Life</i>” to share practical tips on what average folks can do on a daily basis.
            </p>

            <h3 class="join_ul_h3 color_green">“<i>Less Plastic Life</i>” makes reducing waste sound fun. How is that possible?</h3>
            <p class="discourse">
              <span class="person">Koga</span>Moving away from plastic items means more wood, glass and stainless steel in your life. This naturally increases the aesthetics of the things that you use every day. Seeing them, touching them, brings joy. It lifts your spirits. Also, it’s fun to find yourself new items. Changing your lifestyle changes your mood.<br>
              <span class="person">Nakajima</span>You don’t need to cut out plastic entirely. It’s best to start off thinking of it like a game. If you sit your kids down with all the plastic trash you generate in a week and say, “How can we make this less?” they’ll see the fun of it and want to help.
            </p>

            <h3 class="join_ul_h3 color_green">Can “<i>Less Plastic Life</i>” translate into savings?</h3>
            <p class="discourse">
              <span class="person">Koga</span>Except for emergency rations, we stay away from beverages in plastic bottles. We often make our own detergent from citric acid and baking soda. Liquid soaps and body washes can be replaced by soaps in bar form. Mesh bags used for draining compost can be swapped with disposable containers made from newsprint. Each of these solutions saves you money, so collectively they help reduce expenses.
            </p>

            <h3 class="join_ul_h3 color_green">Lots of people have started to carry their own bags to the grocery store. What other similar things could we start taking with us?</h3>
            <p class="discourse">
              <span class="person">Koga</span>If you bring your own plastic containers when you go out to eat, you’ll never need a takeout box. We always pack our own straws and forks. Since the real issue with plastic bags is throwing them away after one use, you can pack a plastic bag and use it several times.
            </p>

            <h3 class="join_ul_h3 color_green">What should people look for in a water bottle?</h3>
            <p class="discourse">
              <span class="person">Nakajima</span>The most important thing is a simple construction that allows for easy cleaning. No unnecessary features.<br>
              <span class="person">Koga</span>It’s fun to look at all the different options and find the one that’s right for you.
            </p>

              <img src="/jp/ja/contents/sustainability/jointpoc/less_plastic_life/img/interview_img_01_EN.jpg" alt="What should people look for in a water bottle?">

            </div>

            <h3 class="join_ul_h3 color_green">Are glass bottles better for the environment?</h3>
            <p class="discourse">
              <span class="person">Nakajima</span>That is an important question. If you throw away a glass bottle after a single use, just like plastic, glass is an environmental burden. Since it’s so heavy, it costs a lot to transport, and melting it down to recycle it takes lots of fuel. Plus, broken glass can be a hazard. But if it isn’t made to be thrown away, glass can be used almost indefinitely, which means a much lower environmental impact in the long run.<br>
              <span class="person">Koga</span>Single use products are really the main problem.<br>
              <span class="person">Nakajima</span>It’s also crucial to tighten up recycling programs so that plastic doesn’t wind up in the ocean. It’s not plastic that’s to blame, but the way we use it.
            </p>

            <h3 class="join_ul_h3 color_green">What about biodegradable plastics? Don’t they decompose?</h3>
            <p class="discourse">
              <span class="person">Nakajima</span>The biodegradable plastics made from corn starch that we see in clear egg cartons and the like contain something called “polylactides.” Unfortunately, polylactides don’t decompose so easily. They require a temperature of approximately 60°C to begin to biodegrade. Ocean temperatures are far too low for them to break down. The fact that they’re derived from plants means less reliance on petroleum, but biodegradable plastics can’t solve everything.<br>
              <span class="person">Koga</span>Some plastic bags are only 25% polylactides, but if you throw them out, it’s the same old problem.<br>
              <span class="person">Nakajima</span>Polylactides don’t use petroleum and can be recycled, so with the right recycling system in place, they’re a good material. Development is underway for plastics that will break down in the cooler temperatures of the ocean, which is something to look forward to. We can’t get by without plastics of any kind. Disposability is a requirement for the syringes used at medical facilities for administering drugs and vaccines.<br>
              <span class="person">Koga</span>Same goes for IV drips.<br>
              <span class="person">Nakajima</span>Disposable products help to ensure sanitary conditions. We might even say our life expectancy has gotten longer thanks to plastic.
            </p>

            <div class="join_ul_contents_img img_addBorder">

              <img src="/jp/ja/contents/sustainability/jointpoc/less_plastic_life/img/interview_img_02_EN.jpg" alt="What about biodegradable plastics? Don’t they decompose?">

            </div>

            <h3 class="join_ul_h3 color_green">Once you start making these adjustments, how much “less plastic” will you use?</h3>
            <p class="discourse">
              <span class="person">Koga</span>At home, between the two of us and our child, we only use one kilogram or so of plastic per month. That’s about one-third of the average plastic used by a Japanese household. It just requires a little attention.<br>
              <span class="person">Nakajima</span>The biggest dent you can make is cutting back on plastic bottles. They’re heavier than you might think, so cutting them out makes a huge difference.
            </p>

            <h3 class="join_ul_h3 color_green">What can people do today to move towards a “Less Plastic” lifestyle?</h3>
            <p class="discourse">
              <span class="person">Koga</span>The simplest and best thing you can do is start using bar soap. Switching from body wash and liquid soaps to bars not only reduces plastic waste dramatically, it saves you money. Plastic trash bags cost a lot of money, too, and become trash in their own right, but you can make your own from newspaper. Plastic clothespins and hangers become surprisingly brittle through exposure to UV rays. Investing in stainless steel alternatives will reduce your plastic consumption over time.<br>
              <span class="person">Nakajima</span>The kitchen sponge you use to wash your dishes every day can be replaced with a tawashi scrubber made from hemp palm. It’s an easy switch, no inconvenience whatsoever.<br>
              <span class="person">Koga</span>It’s a win-win situation. I’d even say it’s a more pleasant experience.
            </p>

            <h3 class="join_ul_h3 color_green">Has the pandemic resulted in more plastic waste? </h3>
            <p class="discourse">
              <span class="person">Koga</span>It sure has. Look at how foods have been individually wrapped, to stop the spread. More takeout means more trash from the containers. What you can do is carry your own bento box or reusable containers, while cutting back on disposables.<br>
              <span class="person">Nakajima</span>Since the pandemic brought about an economic downturn, there was a slight decline in plastic production overall, but also a huge increase in disposable items like masks and gloves. Since plastics can save lives, this is one of those times when we must weigh the pros and cons.
