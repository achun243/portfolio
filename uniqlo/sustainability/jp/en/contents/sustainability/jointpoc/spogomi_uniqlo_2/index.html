            <p class="discourse">
              <span class="person">Okada</span>Lots of clothes are made using petroleum-based materials. These products are especially common in activewear, but also in warm fleeces. This leads to yet another branch of the “plastics problem.” When washed, these clothes shed what’s called microfibers, which enter rivers and oceans via the sewage system. Microfibers have been found inside of fish and other aquatic species, demonstrating their environmental impact. Companies using these petroleum-based textiles are being held to task. This has led to the establishment of the Microfibre Consortium, 1* created to assess the situation at an industrial level so that we, as manufacturers, can implement effective counterstrategies.<br>The subject has been researched now from several different angles, but we’ve yet to come up with a radical solution. UNIQLO has also been exchanging information with other companies and labs to redouble our efforts. I think it would be great if we could take a cue from how we’ve been addressing plastic waste and develop a practical strategy that brings our customers into the fold.
            </p>

              <br>
              A member-based nonprofit organization for promoting the development of practical solutions for addressing microfiber pollution at the industry level, with the goal of drastically reducing the amount of microfibers released into the environment during manufacturing and during the lifespan of a product. With a stated vision of “a future in which the release of microfibers into the environment is reasonably managed,” they support experimental industrial processes devised through clinical trials and provide brands, retail outfits, and suppliers with concrete solutions for protecting the ecosystem. Fast Retailing has participated since September 2019.

            <h3 class="join_ul_h3 color_green">Long-Lasting Clothes Cut Down on Waste</h3>
            <p class="discourse">
              <span class="person">Okada</span>People have started using laundry nets that prevent microfibers from entering the wastewater. Laundry machine makers have begun to certify the effectiveness of their filtration technologies. There’s also the problem of how often we wash clothes. Underwear and other garments that are worn against the skin may require frequent washing, but fleeces don’t, in the same way that it’s fine to only dry clean a wool overcoat at the end of the season. We’ve come to understand that microfibers are most readily shed at the start of an item’s life, so using items for as long as possible is one practical strategy. By making high-quality, durable clothing that won’t go out of style, and encouraging our customers to get the most out of their clothes, we can decrease the environmental burden. We’re focused on refining our stance toward making clothes and on finding new ways to promote the practice of wearing these quality goods for the duration of their usable lifespans. Recently, convenience stores and supermarkets have been posting signs in the milk aisle asking customers to “take cartons from the front, to reduce waste.” This led me to let go of my own habit of checking the expiry dates and reaching for items at the back of the dairy case. It’s important for a message to be heard loud and clear.

            <h3 class="join_ul_h3 color_green">Strategies for Upping the Excitement</h3>
            <p class="discourse">
              <span class="person">Mamitsuka</span>For people to change the way they behave, they need a taste of the “extraordinary.” Making a game out of picking up trash around town was an extraordinary experience for me. Pretty soon, I realized it was really fun! This opened up a new perspective.<br><br>But it takes ingenuity to make the extraordinary into something fun. For the Spo-Gomi x UNIQLO collaboration, we give participants proper rulebooks as well as uniforms with fun logos, a stark departure from the makeshift items that we’re used to handing out! Just seeing this stuff makes people excited to get going. It was a huge lesson for me to acknowledge that these finer points can boost enthusiasm in untold ways.<br>
              <span class="person">Okada</span>Thank you. Sometimes a small touch is enough to boost a person’s spirits. Providing contestants with quality goods not only makes things more fun for them, but it also makes the events way more fun for us to organize.<br>
              <span class="person">Mamitsuka</span>Fun is crucial to the experience. I’d love to see a pro league for Spo-Gomi and I’m curious what it would take to stage a global championship event. To make a dream reality, you need to keep the strategies fun and exciting!
            </p>

            <h3 class="join_ul_h3 color_green">Straws and Sea Turtles</h3>
            <p class="discourse">
              <span class="person">Okada</span>How have the reactions to Spo-Gomi differed from one country or region to the next?<br>
              <span class="person">Mamitsuka</span>At an event in Panama, we were explaining the rules to a local official when they asked us to “give higher points for straws.” Videos of sea turtles with plastic straws stuck in their nostrils have become a viral symbol of marine pollution, but at supermarkets and convenience stores in Panama, it’s standard for a straw to be provided with the purchase of every bottled or canned drink. Drinking with straws is a common thing in Panama, but lately people have been pushing back, in a movement to “say no to straws.”<br>
              <span class="person">Okada</span>At a Spo-Gomi x UNIQLO event in Kyoto, a team of high school girls turned off the beaten path and discovered parts of town they hadn’t even known existed. Opportunities like this provide a chance to recalibrate the way they think of their community. I mean, who’s going to toss trash in their own yard or on their terrace?
            </p>

            </div>

            <h3 class="join_ul_h3 color_green">Local Discoveries While Reducing Trash</h3>
            <p class="discourse">
              <span class="person">Mamitsuka</span>You’re absolutely right. Glancing at a local map helps people pool their intel on the neighborhood and think about what’s there, things like “Hey, I walk down that street all the time, the plants are full of litter,” or “I always see grownups smoking in that park when I’m there playing.”<br><br>Sometimes we’ll add special rules to the game. When we did an event in Nagano Prefecture, which is famous for its soba noodles, we found out that the kids there aren’t too clued into the soba culture, so we asked them to photograph a soba shop whenever they saw one, for extra points. These rules can be tailored to whatever community we’re in. This time around, it had the happy result of school-aged kids discovering that their town was chock full of soba restaurants.<br>
              <span class="person">Okada</span>Littering stems, at least in part, from a lack of connection to a given place. As our sense of community deteriorates, the litter piles up.<br>
              <span class="person">Mamitsuka</span>I’ve been telling the staff from the start that our end goal is to make Spo-Gomi redundant. To get there, we’re spreading the word far and wide, for all to hear.
            </p>

            <h3 class="join_ul_h3 color_green">Making the Practice Obvious</h3>
            <p class="discourse">
              <span class="person">Okada</span>This resonates with me. The department that I work in, as an end goal, wants to see the kind of work we do become unnecessary. We need to move away from sustainability and community building as the tasks of specialized departments, and towards a future where these things are obvious, a part of all the work we do.<br>
              <span class="person">Mamitsuka</span>That’s so well put.<br>
              <span class="person">Okada</span>Ideally, in five or ten years, I’d be out of a job!<br>
              <span class="person">Mamitsuka</span>Reaching the goal would make it obsolete. The same way that someday—if we’re successful—there won’t be any more trash to collect. Alright, game on!
