                    “The Economy of Life” and a “Positive Society”
                  </h3>

                  <p class="contents_wrap_text">
                    <span class="discourse_person">Attali</span>This is the second time I have met you, Mr. Yanai. I am glad to have
                    this opportunity to talk about important issues again.<br>
                    <span class="discourse_person">Yanai</span>So am I, Dr. Attali. So, Dr. Attali, I believe one of the biggest problems
                    the world is facing right now is environmental destruction. Humanity is on
                    the brink of survival, and we must ask ourselves “how much time is there
                    left for us?” This crisis has accelerated even further considering the
                    COVID-19 pandemic (hereinafter “the pandemic”).<br>
                    <span class="discourse_person">Attali</span>Environmental issues are important, as you point out. On that front,
                    it goes without saying that the need to pursue sustainability is crucial, but I
                    do not think that is enough. We must not overlook social issues and issues
                    of democracy. Aren’t our current politics demoralizing people? Are workers
                    treated properly? Are we not making grave mistakes in the way we treat
                    minorities? A sustainable society requires not only the ecological but the
                    economic and political aspects working properly. On top of that, society
                    needs to act with the interests of the next generations in mind. I call such a
                    society a “Positive Society.”<br>
                    <span class="discourse_person">Yanai</span> In “L'économie de la vie (The Economy of Life)”, the book you just
                    published, you wrote that “the Economy of Life” will be important in the
                    post-corona world. You have pointed out that areas such as wellness,
                    education, hygiene, food, agriculture, and clean energy will play a vital role
                    for the next generation.<br>
                    <span class="discourse_person">Attali</span>Exactly. A society that values “the Economy of Life” is a “Positive
                    Society” that values the next generation. And in the area of clothing,
                    clothes will be included as a part of “the Economy of Life” by not only being
                    made of sustainable materials, but also being long-lasting and contributing
                    to wellness and hygiene. Clothes that are discarded quickly will not benefit
                    the next generation. There will be more of a demand for clothing with
                    respect for nature and humanity in the future.<br>
                    <span class="discourse_person">Yanai</span>I feel that the pandemic is certainly changing our lifestyles, as well
                    as the type of clothing consumers seek. Clothing that feels more
                    comfortable, healthy, and that can allow us to express ourselves by
                    wearing it, is becoming crucial. Needless to say, materials and
                    manufacturing processes must be sustainable. At the same time, it will be
                    more important for clothing to play a part in making the environment a
                    better place to pass on to the next generation.<br>
                    <span class="discourse_person">Attali</span>That is exactly an action which is in the interests of our next
                    generations. We are the grandparents of all humanity, and we must act like
                    grandparents of humanity yet to be born. In any work, we need to ask
                    ourselves the question: “Is what we are doing part of ‘the Economy of Life’?”<br>
                    <span class="discourse_person">Yanai</span>With a crisis like the pandemic, we should think positively and
                    change our industries, including clothing, in solidarity with the world.<br>
                    However, the world is even more divided socially and politically right now. <br>
                    <span class="discourse_person">Attali</span>Climate change, the pandemic, and conflicts around the world are all
                    major risks hovering above us like black clouds. However, just like in
                    football games, we must analyze the strengths of the opposition and
                    understand the risks when we play. If there is a country politically opposing
                    us, we should start by understanding its culture and respect it. That may
                    provide a way to rebuild a relationship without things quickly becoming
                    hostile. It is paramount to understand the opponent.

                    Altruism drives problem solving
                  </h3>
                  <p class="contents_wrap_text">
                    <span class="discourse_person">Yanai</span>An inward-looking mindset is becoming a global trend, and some
                    only seem to care about their own country or the environment close to
                    them. This is causing problems in many regions in the world. If a country
                    only pursues its own interests, it may lead to conflicts or frictions. Also,
                    there seems to be less compassion for others. Some view the differences
                    in race and ethnicity as a barrier, and do not try to see or think about the
                    differences in culture.<br>
                    Without a relative perspective, we would end up having a narrow-minded
                    interpretation of the world that only respects our own culture. No positive
                    power will come from such an insular way of seeing. The pandemic hit us
                    when this situation was getting worse. This is an emergency that requires
                    global solidarity, yet we cannot seem to find the momentum for it. Another
                    thing that worries me is that we are losing our willingness to look at things
                    in an historical perspective. The present is made up of an accumulation of
                    what happened in the past. If we do not know or care about the past, we
                    cannot understand the present in a true sense.<br>
                    <span class="discourse_person">Attali</span> It was not as though no one could have ever foreseen conflicts
                    between human beings like WWII. Many people predicted the war, but
                    failed to stop it. The United Nations, the organization whose core mission
                    is to prevent such conflicts, was not created during WWII, but only after it.<br>
                    Humanity can only learn after experiencing a crisis and ending it in a
                    devastating way. Such a view, however, is too pessimistic. It is the role of
                    rationality and intelligence to create the power to stop devastation before
                    it occurs.<br>
                    I believe that there are many ways to avoid conflicts and to start acting in
                    order to make the world a better place. This is the fundamental idea and
                    attitude behind the “Positive Society.”<br>
                    The same can be said for frictions caused by cultural differences or
                    environmental issues, which can be described as conflicts between
                    humanity and the environment. Altruism, a fundamental requirement of the
                    “Positive Society,” is the starting point and drives us to action for solving
                    these issues. <br>
                    <span class="discourse_person">Yanai</span>Turning the idea into actions—this becomes a big barrier in Japan.
                    Historically, Japanese tend to think that it is not for individuals but for the
                    government or the administration to choose the path and act for the future.<br>
                    There is an ingrained mentality among Japanese that “higher-ups” should
                    decide and solve difficult problems. I believe this is not good enough.<br>
                    Individuals or companies must start acting on their own, otherwise, things
                    that could be changed will not change. Things may become too late to
                    address if we just wait for the government or the state to make a decision.<br>
                    We live in a highly globalized society. I believe that decisions and actions
                    that transcend national borders are more likely to spread quickly and
                    reliably if started by individuals or companies.<br>
                    <span class="discourse_person">Attali</span> Companies with the power and position to promote their own values
                    can become leaders in the “Positive Society” and move society forward.<br>
                    This trend may only accelerate in the future, and I call such companies
                    “Positive Companies.” Altruism must be placed at the core of the corporate
                    philosophy, and corporates must fulfill these responsibilities with their
                    activities. In my opinion, Fast Retailing is in a position to become one of
                    these models. We, as consumers, should also buy products from “Positive
                    Companies” that apply altruism from now on. Shareholders will check to
                    see if they are “Positive Companies.” Investors will choose companies that
                    contribute to the “Positive Society.” Banks financing companies will
                    preferentially choose altruistic companies. Such trends will gradually
                    permeate society and exert their influence on those around it.
