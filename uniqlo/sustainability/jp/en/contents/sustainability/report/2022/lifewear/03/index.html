                      Fill the world with smiles through the Power of Clothing
                    </h3>
                    <p class="contents_wrap_text">
                      Fast Retailing works to identify the needs of socially vulnerable people and  provide support through our products, employees and stores. We invested a value of 3.2 billion yen via social contribution activities in the 2021 fiscal year alone, and provided support to approximately 7.5 million people. <br>
                      For the past 10 years, we have been promoting our Power of Clothing project. Through this project, we raise awareness about refugees and other social issues and work to expand the circle of clothing support via initiatives we host with elementary, junior high and high school students throughout Japan.  <br>
                      Our Grameen UNIQLO social business aims to support employment in Bangladesh and has 16 stores, as of the end of August 2021. All processes, from product planning to production and sales, are carried out in Bangladesh, and all profits are reinvested into the business to create a new circular business model. In addition, we are making efforts in solving problems, such as providing career support for female employees who have difficulty becoming self-reliant and offering basic education opportunities for employees of our supplier’s factories. <br>
                      In the fiscal year of 2025, Fast Retailing, the Fast Retailing Foundation, the Yanai Tadashi Foundation, and Mr. Tadashi Yanai himself, will collaborate to implement social contribution activities worth 10 billion yen in a single fiscal year by expanding their activities, targeting a donation of 10 million items of clothing and will provide support to 10 million people.

                      Clothing made for everyone is only possible by respecting diverse values. Fast Retailing promotes diversity and inclusion across its global business, addressing issues such as gender equality, opportunities for women at work, increased participation of people with disabilities, and an understanding of diverse sexual orientations and gender identities.<br>
                      We strive to realize a workplace where diversity is recognized and valued. We host sessions where executive officers and employees of various backgrounds can meet and discuss with each other. In 2021, we joined the Valuable 500, an international initiative to promote the activities of people with disabilities. Currently, the employment rate in Japan of people with disabilities is 4.6%, and approximately 1,500 employees with disabilities are working in our business worldwide.

                      We proactively communicate to raise public awareness and understanding of sustainability to create opportunities for action—by us and all people. We disclose corporate activities so customers have the transparency they need to purchase products with peace of mind. As part of these efforts, the popular character Doraemon became UNIQLO’s global sustainability ambassador in March 2021. In Doraemon Sustainability Mode, Doraemon appears in green, rather than the traditional blue, to symbolize sustainability for the future of the earth. Doraemon is helping UNIQLO spread the message, in an easy-to-understand way, that we can all change the future through the power of clothing.                    </p>
