                    <p class="product_lead">Full of ingenious designs: hook and loop fastener on the opening in the front part makes it easier to put on and take off; the comparably longer length does not allow the back of the shirt to stick out of trousers even when bending down.  Products made with  AIRism material are comfortable to wear even when perspiring.</p>

The clever design and non-woven fabric filter makes it easier to breathe while wearing the mask. It is jointed stitchless to have softer touch on the skin. Designed by Tokujin Yoshioka.</p>

                      the foundation of product development</h3>
                    <p class="mainLead_txt">
                      Whenever we create new products, our aim is to enrich all lives. And designing for diversity requires awareness and understanding. That’s why we place great value on the needs and insights of our customers everywhere, actively seeking out their views and opinions. <br>
                      In another example, in direct response to customer requests arising from the COVID-19 crisis, we created our AIRism mask in 2020. Since its launch, we have continued to make regular improvements to our AIRism mask based on feedback from customers. <br>
                      In another example, we received a letter from a customer with a disability who faces significant  difficulty getting dressed. Learning about this difficulty was the genesis of UNIQLO’s Front Open Innerwear. As part of the product development process, we visited medical facilities and nursing homes to listen to people who faced such difficulties, including caregivers. We obtained their thoughts on product samples and asked how we might improve designs. Since launching the range, we have created nine items, such as T-shirts, bras, and bodysuits for kids up to 160cm tall. The project has helped a range of people, not only those who are hospitalized or with physical disabilities, but also those living with problems like frozen shoulder or people who have undergone breast cancer surgery. <br>
                      In March 2021, the GU BODY LAB–a special project that supports women’s health– launched GU’s first water-absorbing Triple Guard Shorts. Then, that September, UNIQLO launched its AIRism Absorbent Sanitary Shorts and is accelerating efforts to meet feminine care needs based on our fundamental philosophy of supporting our customers with all of life’s needs, in all stages of their lives.

                    <div class="imgTxt_flex">
                      <p class="mainLead_txt">In bringing LifeWear to all, we aim to understand the specific needs of all customers and to create stores where everybody can enjoy shopping. Therefore, customer feedback is also integral to store and service design.
                        At a UNIQLO store in Moscow, we conducted a pre-opening shopping event for customers with disabilities after rehearsing the event using wheelchairs. Meanwhile, GU co-sponsored an audition for models in wheelchairs and those who use prosthetics and other support aids. While participants choose clothes to wear at the final audition at a real shop, we asked participants about their experience at the store, and gained important viewpoints, such as “It is difficult to pick up products from a wheelchair if stored below knee level” and “the fitting room needs a chair.”</p>
