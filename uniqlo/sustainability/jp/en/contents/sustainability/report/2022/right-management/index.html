                    Through various committees, our company directors, auditors, external advisors and executive officers engage in vigorous discussion to deal with risks and provide solutions to crucial issues such as the environment and human rights.

                    <span class="green_bold">[Sustainability Committee]</span>The company president and CEO, as the executive officer with overall responsibility for sustainability, appoints directors and an executive officer in charge of sustainability. The Sustainability Committee works to promote sustainability activities that align with and leverage the Fast Retailing business. In FY 2021, the committee shaped the direction and momentum of various projects, including efforts to deal with environmental problems, respect for human rights within our supply chain, and social contribution activities. Among these issues, the committee had a special focus on issues related to the environment, specifically climate change, reviewing plans for Fast Retailing’s action in this area.

                    <span class="green_bold">[Human Rights Committee]</span>With an external advisor as its head, the Human Rights Committee advises on human rights due diligence and important human rights issues. In accordance with our 2018 human rights policy, the committee guides operations and promotes education programs to ensure our business is conducted in a way that respects human rights. In the event that information about a potential human rights violation comes through our anonymous hotline or other means, the committee provides counsel for and supervision of investigation and remedial measures.

                    Compliance with laws and social standards is of fundamental importance to healthy business operations.
