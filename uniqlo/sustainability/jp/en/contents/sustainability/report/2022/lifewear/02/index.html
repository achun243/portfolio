                      Fast Retailing, by FY 2030, will reduce greenhouse gas emissions from its own operations by 90% over FY 2019 levels. In the raw materials, fabric and garment production for UNIQLO and GU products will target a 20% reduction of greenhouse gas emissions. All Fast Retailing stores and key offices globally will achieve 100% sourcing of renewable electricity and we formulate a reduction plan in cooperation with our supplier factories. In addition, we will increase the proportion of recycled materials used in our products to approximately 50%.

                      Fast Retailing will continue to strengthen transparency and traceability to raw material level. <br>
                      By March 2022, we plan to publish a list of all garment factories we have ongoing dealings with. In addition to audits at garment factories and core fabric mills, we aim to establish traceability across the whole supply chain, from upstream spinning mills to raw material level. This will be achieved through Fast Retailing site visits, audits by third-party organizations, and third-party certifications. Meanwhile, we will continue to strengthen our human rights policies as one of our highest priorities, including our partnership with the Fair Labor Association (FLA) to pursue a living wage for workers in our supply chain.

                      Promoting a society that does not dispose of clothes
                    </h3>
                    <p class="contents_wrap_text">
                      Fast Retailing believes that we should also take responsibility for what happens to our clothes after they reach the hands of our customers. The LifeWear philosophy of “enriching the lives of all people” is the cornerstone of building a recycling-oriented society, where people wear their clothes for a long time without feeling uneasy or recycle them rather than throwing them away.<br>
                      In 2020, UNIQLO renewed its “All-Product Recycling Initiative” which has been carried out since 2006, under the new name “RE.UNIQLO,” with the goal of reusing and recycling almost all our products. For this purpose, not only do we reuse clothes, we have started to recycle clothes into new ones. <br>
                      As a first step, we are collecting old down products and progressing with recycled down products. In addition, we are also recycling our products into materials other than clothes, such as alternative fuel and soundproofing materials for cars. Moreover, we will continue to evaluate the clothing needs of refugees and people in crisis, building on our hard work of 15 years to find good uses for our used clothing.<br>
                      We are currently collecting clothes at all UNIQLO and GU stores, and will consider adding more collection methods to make it easier for customers to participate in recycling.

                      Innovating to extend the clothing life cycle

                    <p class="contents_wrap_text">
                      We believe that in order for people to use our clothes for a long time, we need to create a better system that makes it easy for customers to repair, reuse or donate, while we continue to offer durable clothing. To this end, Fast Retailing has started collaborating with external partners.<br>
                      In August 2021, we launched a “Second Life Studio” as a trial at one UNIQLO store in Germany, offering a clothing repair service in cooperation with the NGO Berliner Stadtmission.
                      In the area of recycling  clothes and developing new materials, we are planning to proceed with research and development with Toray Industries, Inc. Beyond the boundaries of industry, we will continue to search for partner companies that can work with us to develop future services and technologies related to clothing.
