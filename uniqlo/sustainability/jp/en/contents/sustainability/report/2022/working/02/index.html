                        A new employment insurance system in Indonesia is due to come into effect in 2022, which was technically supported through the partnership between Fast Retailing and the ILO. As a private company, Fast Retailing contributed a total of approximately 190 million yen—the largest cumulative contribution by a private company—to our joint project to help envision and establish a social security system to better protect Indonesian workers at times of sudden unemployment. Although apparel brands often do not have employment contracts with factory workers, they autonomously make efforts to protect the human rights of workers in their supply chain and  ensure occupational health and safety in workplaces. In this project, Fast Retailing played a pioneering role to support workers, even beyond its own supply chain or the garment industry. Through its partnership with the ILO, Fast Retailing has contributed to improving the working environments of all Indonesian workers by advancing the country’s<br>
                        social security system. This is a significant achievement that represents strong leadership from a corporation. <br>
                        Throughout the COVID-19 crisis, like many other countries in Asia, Indonesia did not have an employment insurance system as advanced as those in Japan and elsewhere. They faced challenges to provide income security for their unemployed workers. While the country suffered from surging unemployment caused by the pandemic, the implementation of the new employment insurance system will help Indonesia’s workers. When the system goes into effect, workers who have lost their jobs due to factory bankruptcy, dismissal or other unexpected reasons can receive benefits for up to six months during their period of unemployment. In addition, job seekers will be entitled to receive job search assistance that will help them find new work as quickly as possible. This includes training to upgrade skills or reskilling to improve employability in different growth industries. In the consultation process around labor and social security issues, it is always important to reflect the views of the government, workers and employers to develop an effective and sustainable system. The ILO values and promotes such dialogues among the three parties. We worked  together to understand the issues related to the employment insurance system. With the significant achievement of this partnership in Indonesia, the ILO has been receiving requests from other countries in Asia seeking ILO’s technical assistance to improve their own unemployment protection systems. I believe that  Fast Retailing leadership and this pioneering initiative in Indonesia will catalyze efforts of the private sector and help promote decent work for all workers in the world.
