For example, the Committee gives advice and recommendations for investigation and remedial measures in the event a human rights violation comes through our company’s hotline. Furthermore, the Committee offers guidance concerning the implementation of human rights through due diligence, with preventive actions and improvement measures for identified challenges. We have also built education programs to deepen the understanding of respect for human rights.</p>
