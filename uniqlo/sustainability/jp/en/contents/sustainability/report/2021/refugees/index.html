                    “I had hopes and dreams like any other child. I enjoyed time with my family and got to travel every now and then. My childhood in Syria used to be normal like that. Everything changed with the war, and I started my new life as a refugee in England. When I arrived in the UK, I was very excited about life getting back to normal but instead I was faced with people labeling me as a refugee. When people hear the word refugee they expect people who are uneducated, broken, poor and sad. Becoming a refugee does not strip the person of their basic human qualities. Refugees can also become successful by becoming educated and working hard. I study aeronautical engineering at a British university and I have achieved my dream of becoming the first female Syrian refugee to acquire a pilot’s license. What I have experienced as a refugee could happen to anyone in this world. Therefore, I want to change the stereotypes about refugees. This is why I serve as a UNHCR “High Profile Supporter,” and share stories of refugees trying to overcome hardships and the dreams they are trying to achieve in the future. I am conveying that we are no different from anyone else, and I will keep on working hard in order to contribute to solving various problems faced by refugees in the future.”

                        “Former refugee, actor, model, writer, and activist. I’ve lived many lives and there are many titles I’ve accumulated reflecting the opportunities that were offered to me along the way. I have lived in many refugee camps all over Africa including Ethiopia and Kenya, as well as being displaced in Sudan, my home country, to survive before fleeing to the United States. Then, I appeared in a film about refugees, worked as a model, and even wrote a book about my life as a refugee, “Walk Toward the Rising Sun”. I am also working with UNHCR to help refugees. When I was a child, I was separated from my family in the refugee camp after fleeing from the civil war. I remember not having clothes, a pencil, or notebooks to write my ABCs. And I remember countless nights when our bellies had no food. That is how I learned to live, laugh, and care for those who are struggling in refugee camps because I know and understand that life very well. I see how important education is for their futures. Right now, I am particularly focused on education for children. My greatest hopes and dreams are to one day be a part of helping transform refugee camps into functional towns so that refugees can create bigger opportunities for themselves. Why? Because as a former refugee myself, I used to dream in my head that one day I would go back to Akobo, Sudan (now South Sudan) to start my life and rebuild my home and my country.”

                        “I wouldn’t be where I am today without my parents, who always encouraged me in education. They were passionate about education and said ‘we may not be able to leave you much, but we want you to be educated in order for you to gain knowledge and wisdom you need to survive.’ In 1996, I came to Japan alone to escape from oppression in Myanmar, my home country. I didn’t understand Japanese at first, but I studied hard, and graduated from Kwansei Gakuin University through UNHCR Refugee Higher Education Program. Now I am working as an interpreter in Japan. The Refugee Assistance Headquarters of the Foundation for the Welfare and Education of the Asian People provided necessary supports when my mother became sick in Japan, including extension of her stay. Through my experience, I began to think about helping others in the same situation, and now I work as an interpreter and refugee advisor for the foundation. Some social and cultural norms in Japan are sometimes difficult to understand for refugees. I try to communicate in a way that is easy for both sides to understand in such cases. For example, when I accompany them to hospital or city office, I always look them in the eye to make sure they really understand, not just interpreting, and support the communication. I will continue to work for them, hoping more support and understanding for refugees will be realized in Japan. It is also my dream to serve my home country one day.”
