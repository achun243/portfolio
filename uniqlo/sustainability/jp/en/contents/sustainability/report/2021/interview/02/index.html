                    Rules shared globally — is it possible?
                  </h3>

                  <p class="contents_wrap_text">
                    <span class="discourse_person">Yanai</span>I fully agree with the idea and action of altruism. Do you think that
                    altruism is the solution to all problems?<br>
                    <span class="discourse_person">Attali</span>It is worth considering, if we succeed in sharing certain rules globally,
                    to place altruism as the core of actions by people. The rule of law. This is
                    difficult to achieve, but one of the initiatives taken by the EU was this
                    integration by law. The countries in the EU cooperated to lay down a
                    common set of rules. The population of the EU is under 450 million. This
                    may be less than one-tenth of the global population, but the integration
                    cannot be considered small, and it was realized by having a common set
                    of rules. Our way of thinking and actions must be globalized in the global
                    market. Globalization of products alone is not enough to realize a
                    sustainable and open market.<br>
                    Obviously, it is very difficult to share a legal system for all humanity.
                    However, it may be viable, for example, for Fast Retailing and competing
                    global apparel companies to come together, make agreements for the raw
                    material handling, working conditions and so on, create shared rules based
                    on them, and conduct corporate activities. This starts with companies, not
                    the state or the government.<br>
                    <span class="discourse_person">Yanai</span> I do not think that rules will provide a fundamental solution. If only
                    global apparel companies cooperate, we may end up only working within
                    our conventional perspectives and defending our own rights. However,
                    Japanese tend to feel more comfortable working within such a framework,
                    and many managers may prefer a common set of rules in place. Since the
                    Meiji Restoration, Japanese have been good at following and working
                    under the direction or guidance set by “higher-ups.” Because you don’t
                    need to think for yourself as long as you are working hard for the goals and
                    conditions provided by the government. The government also thinks about
                    protecting and encouraging companies. However, this may make it
                    impossible for them to change their course if things go in the wrong
                    direction.

                  <p class="contents_wrap_text">
                    <span class="discourse_person">Yanai</span>How are French people trying to solve the problem of inequality?<br>
                    <span class="discourse_person">Attali</span>Mainly by taxation. The tax rate in France is one of the highest in
                    Europe. People believe this is a worthwhile price to pay to solve inequality
                    and improve general wellbeing and welfare. The Scandinavian nations also
                    have similarly high taxation rates. In return, they provide education and
                    medical care unconditionally. High taxes are a system of altruism, and are
                    rules of consideration for others. A contrasting country is the United States.
                    They have a low tax rate. However, in the United States, it is practically
                    impossible to get advanced medical care if you do not have health
                    insurance.
                    Carbon footprint is a major pressing issue, and it is necessary to introduce
                    a carbon tax on commodities to address this. Carbon footprint is not only a
                    problem for manufacturing but also for importing and exporting across
                    countries. This cannot be solved by a single country, and the involvement
                    of globally operating companies is crucial, among other things. This is the
                    reason why I believe that the various problems Mr. Yanai pointed out
                    cannot be solved entirely on a country basis, and global rules are required.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    <span class="discourse_person">Yanai</span> It is important not to end up with protectionism and groupism. I
                    believe it is crucial for individual companies around the world to freely
                    engage in economic activities. In my opinion, it is not right to make the
                    rules first and then instruct them to go in the same direction as a group.
                    The tax rate was not so high in Japan in the past. However, as the birthrate
                    declines and the population ages, the country is shifting to higher taxes
                    due to the scarcity of financial resources for health and social welfare. <br>
                    <span class="discourse_person">Attali</span>There are 1.9 children per family on average in France. It is 1.4 in
                    Japan. Also, most women in Europe work. People typically do not work for
                    the same company until they retire—in several European countries, they
                    change their jobs every three to five years. People spend their entire lives
                    being educated and trained, and improving their abilities. Just like football,
                    the team is important, but so is fully mobilizing each player’s abilities and
                    potential. Individual abilities can improve further by transferring to another
                    team and expanding playing opportunities. This is the same for workers.
                    Society is also responsible for discovering things individuals are good at
                    and the skills they should improve throughout their lives. This is the idea
                    that a flexible society pays a salary and provides training
                    opportunities at the same time. Individuals improving themselves
                    throughout their lives will eventually enrich society.

                  <p class="contents_wrap_text">
                    <span class="discourse_person">Yanai</span>As you mentioned, more and more people are thinking that
                    the role of lifetime employment may have come to an end. There is
                    no denying that there is a chance for an individual to develop their
                    abilities by changing their job. However, I believe that lifetime
                    employment, not as a system but as a result, is good for both the
                    company and the individual. If a company becomes a group of
                    individuals who repeatedly change their jobs, it is difficult to
                    develop collective or tacit knowledge. When it comes to working
                    and creating something, I believe that deepening relationships and
                    communication with co-workers will develop individual skills and support
                    the company. Even a talented individual may not always perform well
                    immediately. If you change companies, there will inevitably be some tasks
                    you need to learn from scratch, no matter how good you are. We may be
                    able to fully utilize our potential when our objectives and those of the
                    company are aligned and work with a long-term view. Just like a team play
                    in football, I believe it is ideal when everyone works in the same direction
                    as their manager and aims for their goal. The idea of lifetime employment
                    might be hard for people from Europe to understand, though.<br>
                    <span class="discourse_person">Attali</span> I think some Europeans agree with your idea, Mr. Yanai. On the other
                    hand, there must be more and more Japanese people who want to be free
                    from the system of lifetime employment and work more freely—though it is
                    dangerous to put the desire for freedom above everything else. However, I
                    think it has become a global consensus that individuals are free to choose
                    how and where they work. By the way, there is a question I want to ask. Do
                    you think there can be such a thing as a “lifetime consumer”? <br>
                    <span class="discourse_person">Yanai</span> I believe that we must aim to operate as a company that creates
                    lifelong consumers as a result of our actions. Of course, consumers are
                    free to choose. Regarding lifetime employment, I don't think it is
                    unconditionally a good system, obviously. Lifetime employment that has
                    lost its substance is rather harmful. Individuals are free. Companies are
                    free. These are undeniable principles. However, I also believe we should
                    aim for a corporate entity that utilizes the accumulated collective
                    knowledge of an employee. There is a power lifetime employment exerts in
                    this sense. The operations of a company cannot be successful with the
                    power of a single individual. By the way, I had the chance to speak with
                    some people from France recently, and I found out that more of them are
                    working with a lot of enthusiasm in Japan these days.<br>
                    <span class="discourse_person">Attali</span>I think it is because they know the value of going out from their
                    country and gaining a unique experience. It would be nice if more Japanese
                    people would come and work in France.<br>
                    <span class="discourse_person">Yanai</span>Individuals live freely and work globally, participating in local
                    communities and contributing to society. This may be a first step to realize
                    a world without wars or conflicts. In that sense, the roles and
                    responsibilities of companies are even greater.<br>
                    <span class="discourse_person">Attali</span>  It would be wonderful if we have another opportunity to discuss the
                    future of companies or the apparel space in the 21st century from a
                    long-term perspective. I’d love to see you again and talk to you.
