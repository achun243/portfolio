  <h1>2014.11<br>CLOTHING ASSISTANCE<br>IN JORDAN</h1>
  <div class="section section_m">
   <p class="mb10">Since 2012 UNIQLO has provided clothing aid to Syrian refugees in Jordan in a partnership with the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR). To raise awareness of the continuing civil conflict in Syria, UNIQLO encouraged greater participation in the All-Product Recycling Initiatives at all of its stores from 30 April through to 31 July 2014. This campaign was designed to provide warm clothing and heart-shaped cards of encouragement to those in need. Customers who donated clothing wrote their names on heart-shaped cards, as a way to provide hope to Syrian refugees who must endure the cold winter. UNIQLO collected roughly 2 million articles of clothing and approximately 11,000 heart-shaped cards throughout the three-month campaign. Company employees visited Jordan from November 8 to 13, 2014, to deliver the clothing and the cards. This onsite report chronicles their trip.</p>
