    <h1>2020.02<br>Clothing distribution in Malawi<br>“The warm heart of Africa”</h1>
    <div class="section section_m">
    <p class="mb15">Nine UNIQLO and GU employees visited the Republic of Malawi in February 2020 with the mission of distributing recycled clothing donated by our customers to refugees and learning about the supports that these refugees were receiving. This is part of Fast Retailing's longstanding global partnership with the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR). The participants were selected through the in-house application process, and the team went to Malawi, a landlocked eastern African country affectionately nicknamed “the warm heart of Africa,” which locates some 30 hours away by air from Japan. This report chronicles their field visit and brings to light the challenges that the refugees are facing.</p>

The lush green leaves of the harvested corn stalks were very picturesque."><img src="/jp/en/contents/sustainability/society/refugees/clothing_support/archive/photo/malawi/img/200618_malawi_thumb-01.jpg" width="163" height="111" alt="thumbnail" /></a></p>

Nonetheless, the camp was so neat and tidy that it was difficult to believe it was so overcrowded. The refugees were taking care of the property with great respect and, there was little refuse visible.Refugees from the Democratic Republic of the Congo accounted for 60% of the camp’s population, with others coming from Burundi, Rwanda, and Somalia.

Coordination and adjustment by UNHCR were subsequently necessary for safety and security reasons, and this led to a visit several hours behind   schedule. The demonstration was apparently organized because the refugees were informed about   shifting from in-kind to cash assistance but they feel what they got would not be able to cover their needs. The UNHCR explained that support to refugees had been shifted from goods to cash globally, due to the greater flexibility of cash for the beneficiaries. For example, the refugees could use the cash as saving or buy what they truly need. However, due to a chronic shortage of funding, the team learned that the support would not have had reached to satisfy the refugees."><img src="/jp/en/contents/sustainability/society/refugees/clothing_support/archive/photo/malawi/img/200618_malawi_thumb-09.jpg" width="163" height="111" alt="thumbnail" /></a></p>

Center: This 18-year-old youth is from DRC. He has been training judo for three years since the arrival at Dzaleka Refugee Camp. He had a commanding presence that looked much older than his actual age. Right: Girls at age of 13. They are actually twin girls .One day, these judokas who train hard in Dzaleka Refugee Camp could ultimately become members of the Olympic Refugee."><img src="/jp/en/contents/sustainability/society/refugees/clothing_support/archive/photo/malawi/img/200618_malawi_thumb-21.jpg" width="163" height="111" alt="thumbnail" /></a></p>

With just another room to sleep in, the whole space seemed to be quite cramped for a family of seven. Water was boiling in the kitchen, but there were no foods at a glance."><img src="/jp/en/contents/sustainability/society/refugees/clothing_support/archive/photo/malawi/img/200618_malawi_thumb-23.jpg" width="163" height="111" alt="thumbnail" /></a></p>

About 40% of its visitors are refugees, with local Malawians making up the remaining 60%. All received medical care free of charge. The obstetrics ward is apparently seeing 150 births every month (a lot!). Because there are only four beds, it is normal for mothers to be discharged 24 hours after birth. There is a plan to upgrade it into a hospital to accept more mothers and patients. People are receiving care and services that are beneficial for both the refugees and the local Malawians."><img src="/jp/en/contents/sustainability/society/refugees/clothing_support/archive/photo/malawi/img/200618_malawi_thumb-26.jpg" width="163" height="111" alt="thumbnail" /></a></p>

It was located slightly away from the refugee camp and was built through support from UNHCR.The local Malawians and the refugees are operating it together to cultivate nearby fields. The cultivation has been so successful - the harvest has become more than three times  before, and the area becomes one of Malawi’s top producers of tomatoes. Within the camp, chicken and pigs are being raised, and several varieties of vegetables are being cultivated. The farmed vegetables and eggs are apparently being delivered to hotels in Lilongwe, the nation’s capital."><img src="/jp/en/contents/sustainability/society/refugees/clothing_support/archive/photo/malawi/img/200618_malawi_thumb-27.jpg" width="163" height="111" alt="thumbnail" /></a></p>

About 70 students were tightly but neatly seated together. The children of Dzaleka Refugee Camp learn the education curriculum of the Government of Malawi in English. The students showed us their notebooks that they had neatly taken in this livestock class. After the greetings, the team taught them how to fold paper cranes with the origami that the team had brought from Japan."><img src="/jp/en/contents/sustainability/society/refugees/clothing_support/archive/photo/malawi/img/200618_malawi_thumb-28.jpg" width="163" height="111" alt="thumbnail" /></a></p>
