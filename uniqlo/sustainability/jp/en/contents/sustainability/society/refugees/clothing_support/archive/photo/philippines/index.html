  <h1>2014.03<br>Staying Strong and Positive<br>in the Wake of a Natural Disaster<br>-Philippines Typhoon Haiyan Emergency Relief Aid-</h1>
  <div class="section section_m">
   <p class="mb10">In November 2013, Typhoon Haiyan (known as Typhoon Yolanda in the Philippines) devastated portions of Southeast Asia, particularly the Philippines. Originating near the Federal States of Micronesia, it was the strongest typhoon to hit the Philippines in recorded history, with maximum wind speeds of 105 m/s at landfall. It was also the country's deadliest typhoon on record, killing at least 6,000 and leaving an estimated 2,000 people missing. Roughly 16 million people across the country were affected by the storm, with 1.1 million homes either severely damaged or destroyed and 4.1 million people displaced. Six months after the storm, the country had yet to make a full recovery.</p>
   <p class="mb10">This report focuses on the clothing aid that Fast Retailing provided to the residents of Tacloban on Leyte Island, which was one of the areas that was hit hardest by Haiyan. This initiative was made possible with the help of the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) and the Community and Family Services International (CFSI), a local non-governmental organization.</p>
   <p class="mb15">These photos provide insight on the local situation. They were taken by photographer Naoki Ishikawa, who accompanied the Fast Retailing team on this trip.</p>
