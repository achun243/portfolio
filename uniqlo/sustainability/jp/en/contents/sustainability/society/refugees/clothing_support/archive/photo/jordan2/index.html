  <h1>2013.12<br>CLOTHING ASSISTANCE<br>IN JORDAN</h1>
  <div class="section section_m">
   <p class="mb10">About 120,000 Syrians live at the Zaatari refugee camp in Jordan. The camp has become the second largest refugee camp in the world after the Dadaab refugee camp in Kenya. We visited it for a second time almost a year after our first visit.<br>How much had the refugees' lives changed?</p>
   <p class="mb10">We donated 550,000 articles of clothing, which was collected through our All-Product Recycling Initiative, to Syrian refugees. How did the donated UNIQLO clothing help those in need?</p>
   <p class="mb10">This report focuses on the emergency clothing aid that we provided with the help of the (United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) and Japan Emergency NGO (JEN).</p>
