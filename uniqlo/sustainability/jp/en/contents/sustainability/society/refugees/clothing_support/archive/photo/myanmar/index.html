  <h1>2015.02<br>CLOTHING ASSISTANCE<br>IN MYANMAR<br>~Spreading Joy Through Clothing~</h1>
  <div class="section section_m">
   <p class="mb10">The Republic of the Union of Myanmar has many refugees and internally displaced persons (IDPs), both in and outside the country, due to a long period of military rule in the past. From 2014 to 2015, UNIQLO and GU provided clothing aid to IDPs in Myanmar through Fast Retailing's global partnership with the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR).</p>
   <p class="mb10">Located in Southeast Asia, Myanmar has relatively hot humid climate. But the temperature can plummet in some parts of the country at certain times of the year. The people there need clothing that can protect them from the cold weather. This report focuses on Fast Retailing's efforts to provide clothing and the lives of IDPs in the northeastern state of Kachin.</p>
