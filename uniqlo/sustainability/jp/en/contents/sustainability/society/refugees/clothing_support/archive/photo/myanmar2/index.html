    <h1>2016.11<br>Delivering clothing to internally<br>displaced people in Myanmer<br>for a second time</h1>
    <div class="section section_m">
      <p class="mb10">Myanmar transitioned from a military regime that had lasted for more than 50 years to a democratic government in April 2016. The economy is expected to make significant strides.</p>
      <p class="mb10">Nonetheless, conflicts in Kachin and Shan states, protracted displacement and inter communal tensions in Rakhine State, in addition to challenges faced by the country’s stateless populations result in significant humanitarian and protection needs that will continue for the foreseeable future. Whilst the country has made progress in social development, this has never been equal across regions nor across ethnic groups.</p>
      <p class="mb10">This was the second time that Fast Retailing delivered clothing to internally displaced people (IDPs) in Myanmar. We visited two states where the people live in different ways.</p>
