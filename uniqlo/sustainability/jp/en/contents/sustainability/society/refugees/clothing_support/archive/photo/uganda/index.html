  <h1>2015.10<br>Bringing the power of clothing to children in Uganda</h1>
  <div class="section section_m">
   <p class="mb10">In 2015, the United Nation High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) requested Fast Retailing (FR) to send 3 million garments to nine countries in Africa. FR followed up after the donation with a visit to Uganda for the second time.</p>
   <p class="mb10">In 2007, the FR visited Uganda for the first time to donate clothing to refugees and internally displaced people fleeing civil conflict. After a ceasefire was declared, these displaced individuals were able to return home and the camps were closed down.</p>
   <p class="mb10">In 2013, when internal conflicts broke out in the neighboring Democratic Republic of Congo and South Sudan, Uganda began accepting large numbers of refugees. The country has been very active in welcoming refugees, as it has a long history of dealing with civil unrest.</p>
   <p class="mb15">The following is a report on FR's visit to the Kiryandongo Refugee Settlement, which has been in operation for nearly 20 years.</p>
