              <p class="contentsTxt">82.4 million (As of 2020) people have been forced to leave their homes due to conflicts and persecution. Many of them live in environments with inadequate services. With the spread of COVID-19,  they face many other challenges, including their health, education and livelihoods, in refugee camps and densely populated urban spaces.  Under the global partnership, Fast Retailing and UNHCR are distributing AIRism masks to prevent the spread of the virus.  The masks will be distributed to refugees, displaced people and their communities, especially the most vulnerable, children.  Fast Retailing and UNHCR will continue to protect and provide support to people forced to flee to achieve a more sustainable world where “no one is left behind”.</p>

              <p class="contentsTxt">Since the spring of 2020, many schools including the ones in refugee camps, have been closed around the world. Some of the children have been out of school for almost a year. Many have started working to support their families during COVID-19. This contribution is intended to support refugees and displaced children who have been severely affected by the pandemic, through the repair and construction of schools and sanitation facilities, internet connection for online education and financial support to attend school.</p>

                Fast Retailing, UNIQLO’s holding company, has been working with UNHCR since 2006 to provide clothing to refugees and displaced people around the world. In 2011, Fast Retailing became the first Asian company to have a global partnership with UNHCR, the UN Refugee Agency. The partnership celebrates its 10th anniversary in 2021.  The clothing collected by the customers through RE.UNIQLO (UNIQLO’s all products clothes recycling) has been donated to UNHCR. In addition, UNIQLO has been contributing forcibly displaced people through emergency support, livelihood programs, refugee employment at UNIQLO stores, school outreach and communication campaigns.

              <p class="contentsTxt">Opportunities to work and earn a living are critical for refugees to rebuild their lives with dignity. In 2018, UNHCR launched MADE51, a brand of handcrafts made by refugees, to enable them to use the traditional skills of their homelands to become economically independent in their new settlements and contribute to their host communities. Working with local social enterprises, refugees are developing their expertise in design,
                logistics and marketing to create products that can be sold in the global market. Since 2020, we have supported MADE51 as part of its refugee self-reliance program, helping to raise brand awareness and support for refugees as they earn a living for themselves and their families.</p>
