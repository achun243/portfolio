  <h1>2015.06<br>CLOTHING ASSISTANCE<br>IN THAILAND</h1>
  <div class="section section_m">
   <p class="mb10">In June 2015, UNIQLO Thailand, together with Shanti Volunteer Association, visited to Amphur Maesot for the second time. The Recycling Clothing Donation was held at a school for the displaced people living in a community located in the Phob Pra area - which was identified by Shanti Volunteer Association (SVA) as an area in need. The community consists of roughly 220 people, who moved from Myanmar 20 years ago, and has 50 students and 3 teachers. They are working for the owner of the land for a daily wage. Most built wooden housing on the land and do not have any electricity.</p>
   <p class="mb15">We brought about 6,500 pieces of clothing and "Power of Clothing" to this area.</p>
