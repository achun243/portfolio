  <h1>2016.05<br>Bringing the power of clothing to refugees in Rwanda</h1>
  <div class="section section_m">
   <p class="mb10">The global refugee situation has reached crisis proportions with an unprecedented number of refugees living in difficult circumstances.</p>
   <p class="mb10">Fast Retailing launched the '10 Million Ways to Help' project in collaboration with UNHCR in September 2015, aiming to collect 10 million pieces of second-hand clothing for refugees world wide through its All-Product Recycling Initiative.</p>
   <p class="mb15">As part of this project, Fast Retailing donated around 540,000 items to refugees in Rwanda. The following report highlights the plight of refugees in Rwanda and how Fast Retailing is trying to help through "the power of clothing".</p>
