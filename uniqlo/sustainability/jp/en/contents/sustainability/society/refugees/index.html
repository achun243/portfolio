          <h2 class="cover_subTtl">To create a world where no one is forced to flee.</h2>
          <p class="cover_lead">According to UNHCR, the UN Refugee Agency, over 100 million people* around the world have been driven from their homes by conflict and persecution or are being forced to flee due to war and oppression. UNIQLO has been working with UNHCR since 2006 to support them. In 2011, UNIQLO and UNHCR entered a global partnership and since then we have been  providing continuous support to people who have been forcibly displaced, regardless of their circumstances or where they come from. Along with UNHCR, in collaboration with other NGOs, we do not only provide goods and financial donations, but also extend comprehensive support to enable refugees and other displaced people to build new lives by offering vocational training and providing employment, boosting self-reliance.</p>

                  <p class="subImg_lead">For the humanitarian emergency in Ukraine, Fast Retailing, parent company of UNIQLO, donated US$10 million (approx. ¥1.15 billion) to UNHCR to support people forced to flee. The donation provided urgent assistance such as shelter, psychosocial support and emergency supplies to affected populations in Ukraine and neighboring countries. In response to UNHCR's needs, Fast Retailing also announced a donation of 100,000 items of clothing and other products, such as UNIQLO HEATTECH blankets and HEATTECH innerwear. Individual UNIQLO operations in the EU have also started donating UNIQLO products and recycled clothes, including secondhand winter clothing that customers have brought into our stores. We are also raising funds from our employees and customers, and we have launched an employment program for those who have fled Ukraine in Germany and the Netherlands.</p>

As such, life in refugee camps or densely populated urban spaces carry a high risk of infection.  In 2021, Fast Retailing donated over 3 million UNIQLO AIRism masks to UNHCR for distribution to refugees and internally displaced persons worldwide as well as host communities. Fast Retailing also donated US$100,000 to help UNHCR respond to the coronavirus pandemic with essential support and services, including assistance to children deprived of educational opportunities due to COVID-19.</p>

                  <p class="subImg_lead">Even before the full-fledged onset of winter, when temperatures can fall below zero, many persons forcibly displaced in Afghanistan and surrounding regions had suffered from drought and other natural disasters, as well as food shortages. All of these are in addition to the risk of COVID-19.  Fast Retailing donated US$800,000 (approximately 92 million yen) in winter assistance to UNHCR to provide relief supplies, such as blankets, solar lanterns and tent insulation kits, to allow people forced to flee, especially women and children in particularly vulnerable situations, to protect themselves from sub-zero temperatures.  Fast Retailing and UNIQLO U.S.A  also donated over 42,000 winter items including fleece jackets and Heattech innerwear to people evacuated from Afghanistan in partnership with International Organization for Migration (IOM) and other local partners.</p>

We have used MADE51 products as novelty items, which have helped to expand sales and brand visibility of MADE51. In 2021, 354 refugee artisans participated in the production of those items. Eighty-five per cent of the participating refugees said that they have been able to use the money they earned from the project to buy food for their families or pay for their children’s education and medical needs. Since 2021, Fast Retailing has donated US$100,000 each year to MADE51, totaling US$200,000 to date (approximately 25.5 million yen). That donation is used for various purposes, including seed funding for local social enterprises who collaborate with MADE51, as well as developing product branding and strengthening MADE 51’s online store.</p>

              <p class="subImg_lead">The Power of Clothing Project is an outreach and online learning program run by UNIQLO  employees that teaches students about the diverse value of clothing and global refugee situations. After attending the lecture, children run their own original projects to collect secondhand children’s clothes that the students or children in the local community no longer wear. Those clothes are then sorted and delivered to refugees living in refugee camps or those in need through UNHCR.</p>
