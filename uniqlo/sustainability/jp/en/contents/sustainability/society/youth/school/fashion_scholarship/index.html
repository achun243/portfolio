                            The Fast Retailing Foundation established the Global Graduate Fashion Scholarship (GGFS) .<br>
                            It aims to help inspired and talented students study at world-class fashion graduate schools and contribute to the development of a better society through the power of fashion and design.<br>
                            <br>
                            The GGFS seeks to support students who have the enthusiasm and aspiration to better our society by sharing the knowledge and skills they acquire through the program.<br>
                            We look for students who pursue knowledge and expertise not for its own sake, but for how that knowledge can connect and support a more integrated, future-oriented approach to solving real world problems and developing a better society.<br>
                            <br>
                            We expect that the GGFS scholars will emerge as the next generation of leaders by providing them with the best possible environment for study and the experience of learning from professors together with a diverse and talented group of students from around the world.
