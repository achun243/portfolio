      <dd><b>Project No. 1: Ogatsu Suzuri Association</b><br />
        Ogatsu Suzuri Association developed inkstone tableware as an additional source of revenue, so it could continue to make traditional crafts. It developed these dishes long before the earthquake. It plans to sell its goods online and in overseas markets, while expanding its customer base through new product development. The association plans to brand its new tableware products with "tradition" and "new frontiers" as key concepts.</dd>

      <dd><b>Project No. 2: Sato Shipyard</b><br />
        After being devastated by the quake and tsunami, Sato Shipyard resumed operations, despite the limited amount of equipment and resources it had on hand. The No.8 Taisei Maru is the first ship to be repaired and launched from the shipyard since the disaster.<br>
        "Thanks to Sato Shipyard's Fumihiko Sato, I have been in a positive frame of mind and have been wanting to go out to sea as quickly as possible," said Masataka Tsuda, the owner of the No. 8 Taisei Maru. "I lost my boat to the disaster. For a few months, I worked at removing rubble. Sato called me and said he had a damaged boat in his shipyard. He said I could use it if I could repair it. The support from Sato Shipyard was huge."</dd>

     <h2>Future plans</h2>
     <p>In the fiscal year to September 30, 2012, Tohoku Relationship Capital provided management support and 96 million yen in funding for six projects, while creating a financial network to support reconstruction. In the fiscal year from October 2012 to September 2013, Tohoku Relationship Capital will continue to use private funds to actively develop projects in Fukushima and the rest of the Tohoku region. Specifically, Tohoku Relationship Capital is working to provide three types of funds for businesses, in cooperation with government agencies and a range of financial institutions. The three types of funds are capital for business growth, additional capital to handle activities that are not covered by government subsidies, and bedrock capital to support businesses struggling under multiple debts.<br>
      Tohoku Relationship Capital will also dispatch external experts in areas such as management support, business reconstruction, product development and market expansion to fund recipients. It will continue with its efforts to maximize the business value of those receiving support.</p>
