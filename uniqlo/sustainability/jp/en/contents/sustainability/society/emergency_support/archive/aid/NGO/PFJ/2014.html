     <h2>Action Plan under Recovery Assistance Project in 2014</h2>
     <p class="NGO2013">PlaNet Finance Japan assisted small-scale business operators that were hit by the disaster to restart their businesses and entrepreneurs to start new ones through the following three programs.</p>
     <dl class="NGO2013">
      <dt><b>1</b></dt>
      <dd class="num"><b>Aid to rebuild devastated regions and create new businesses:</b><br />
        PlaNet Finance Japan has aided new businesses that meet the needs of the devastated areas to start operations since the disaster. It has helped entrepreneurs who have the experience and abilities to run a business and who are also very committed to helping the area recover.</dd>
     </dl>
     <dl class="NGO2013">
      <dt><b>2</b></dt>
      <dd class="num"><b>Aid for disaster-hit companies seeking to hire employees:</b><br />
        PlaNet Finance Japan has aided small-scale businesses that were hit by the disaster hire the people they need to restart operations.</dd>
     </dl>
     <dl class="NGO2013">
      <dt><b>3</b></dt>
      <dd class="num"><b>Program to partially subsidize the interest on loans that were taken out to assist recovery:</b><br />
        PlaNet Finance Japan has worked together with Kesennuma Shinkin Bank to provide financing that reduces the burden of loan payments by partially subsidizing the interest for two years. The program promotes greater access to capital for small-scale businesses that struggled to secure financing after they were hit by the disaster.</dd>
     </dl>
     <p class="NGO2013">
      In 2014, PlaNet Finance Japan allocated greater effort and resources to the new business creation program of the three aforementioned programs. It has supported young entrepreneurs who are applying their experience and abilities to start new businesses that meet community needs in Kesennuma, Rikuzentakata, Ofunato and Minimisanriku. One individual who was originally from Ofunato returned to the city and opened a cake shop, applying the experience gained from working as a pastry chef in Tokyo before the disaster. One individual who was originally an apple farmer in Rikuzentakata opened Farmers' Café, which is frequented by local residents. He used the experience he gained from working as a store manager of a Tokyo eatery before the disaster. PlaNet Finance Japan encouraged and supported such entrepreneurs who decided to help recovery in the region.<br>
      PlaNet Finance Japan also stationed a person in Kesennuma to continuously monitor those who received aid and provide tailored assistance. In June 2014, it invited Ryoichi Matsuyama, the president of the Japan National Tourism Organization, to visit. It also held workshops and seminars on tourism recovery for business operators that received aid.
