Fast Retailing, the operator of the UNIQLO and GU brands, aims to reduce GHG emissions across all of our activities – from product manufacturing to disposal – to reduce the impact of our business on climate and biodiversity. We are now working towards specific targets that honor the goals set in the Paris Agreement on Climate Change to reduce greenhouse gases emissions by 2050, in accordance with the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change.</p>

                    <p class="climate_txt">At UNIQLO and GU, we are working hard to reduce GHG emissions by lowering our electricity consumption. Through a program to install LED lighting at UNIQLO stores throughout Japan, among other measures, we aim to reduce GHG emissions by 10% per unit of floor area by the end of fiscal 2020 (compared to fiscal 2013 levels). We have now successfully introduced LED lighting in 782 UNIQLO stores (96.5% of total stores) and 397 GU stores (97.3%),(*1) representing a reduction in GHG emissions of approximately 38.7% per unit of floor area.(*2) We are also striving towards greater energy efficiency by installing air conditioning control systems that automatically regulate ambient temperature. Eight UNIQLO stores in Japan, including our UNIQLO PARK Yokohama Bayside Store, have acquired Gold Level LEED® (Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design) certification in the Building Operations & Maintenance (O+M) category.(*3)</p>

To date, we have already completed the switch to 100% renewable energy in our stores in Europe, North America, Vietnam, Indonesia, and Thailand. Efforts are now focused on introducing renewable energy in UNIQLO and GU stores across Japan, starting with the installation of solar panels at 13 stores.(*4)</p>

We are also aiming to increase the proportion of recycled materials used in our products to approximately 50% by fiscal 2030. So far, we have used recycled polyester fibers in our DRY-EX and Fluffy Fleece clothing items. Going forward, we intend to expand the use of materials that place a lower burden on the environment, starting with synthetic fibers such as rayon and nylon.</p>

From fiscal 2021 onwards, we are leveraging our strong partnerships with production factories to steadily reduce GHG emissions in our supply chain to the fiscal 2030 target level. As part of these efforts, we have identified the chief issues at each of our core partner factories, which collectively account for 90% of UNIQLO and GU manufacturing. We have also formulated a Greenhouse Gas Emissions Reduction Plan that incorporates energy-saving measures, decarbonation efforts, and the introduction of renewable energy. Further, we have strengthened our Production and Sustainability departments to ensure that our plans for reducing GHG emissions are implemented, and continue to monitor progress and manage these projects.</p>
