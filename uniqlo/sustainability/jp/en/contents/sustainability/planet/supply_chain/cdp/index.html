          <p class="cover_lead">UNIQLO always strives to use resources effectively and without waste, both within our own company and across our entire supply chain. We are committed not only to helping reduce the impact of our business on the environment, but also to building a sustainable business through the use of cutting-edge technologies. Our environmental initiatives can be divided into five areas: responding to climate change, improving energy efficiency, managing water resources, improving waste management and resource efficiency, and managing chemical substances. Alongside taking action within our company, we are also working with our partners on various initiatives to change ways of thinking across our supply chain. These efforts have been recognized by broader society, with Fast Retailing (operator of international brands UNIQLO, GU, and Theory, among others) selected for the CDP A List.

              <p class="subImg_lead">In recognition of the company’s proactive initiatives and transparency related to climate change and water security, Fast Retailing was selected for the 2022 A List by CDP, the international non-profit organization that operates a global environmental disclosure platform. CDP's annual environmental disclosure and scoring process is widely recognized as the gold standard of corporate environmental transparency. Of the more than 10,000 companies evaluated, Fast Retailing was one of a small number recognized as an A List company in two areas.</p>

              <p class="attention_txt">CDP, a UK-based international non-profit organization, maintains a comprehensive database of corporate activities, and its proprietary disclosure processes and methodologies have established a high degree of trust. In 2022, more than 680 financial institutions with over US$130 trillion in assets, and 280 major procurement companies with expenditure of US$6.4 trillion, called on corporations worldwide to disclose data through the CDP platform on environmental impact, risks, and opportunities – with a record 18,700 companies responding.</p>
