                <p class="cover_lead">
                  It only takes a little creativity to give your worn-out clothes new life. The repair shop at the UNIQLO Regent Street store was inspired by a Berlin-based initiative that began as our first in-store repair studio. We chose Berlin for this new venture because of the city’s receptivity to tailoring in general and to traditional Japanese practices, like kintsugi, in particular.<br>
                  Though in the beginning, our staff had never done more than hem trousers. To bridge the gap, we’ve been partnering since 2015 with Berliner Stadtmission, an NGO that collects used clothes at our stores and sorts out items that can be used as-is from those ready to be upcycled. With their collaboration, we opened a repair and upcycling studio at the Berlin Tauentzienstrasse store in August 2021.<br>
                  This isn’t some clinical transaction, where a customer drops off old clothes to be repaired by somebody they’ll never meet, but an opportunity for UNIQLO and customers to make something together. To do this, we hold workshops where we have a conversation about clothing and the true value of repairs while mending items. For the first ten months, studio space was available free of charge on afternoons Thursday through Saturday, alongside regular paid services. By hosting these collaborative events, we’ve helped to make upcycling a familiar practice.<br>
                  Our goal is for the atmosphere to combine play with creativity. You might sit down and make a tote bag from a pair of jeans or T-shirt, or use some denim fabric to create a wallet or even a pair of earrings. It’s easy to view these things through the lenses of ecology and sustainability, but this practice of exchanging ideas with customers while making new, unique objects has had the added benefit of capturing the interest of staff in other regions. As a result, the repair studio idea has branched out from Berlin to other UNIQLO stores all over the world.

                <p class="cover_lead">
                  We followed Berlin’s example and opened a RE.UNIQLO repair store at our SoHo store in January 2022. These in-store repair services have become quite popular in the US among customers who want to get the most out of their clothes. Simple repair jobs like fixing holes in down jackets and jeans have won the hearts of New Yorkers, known for their discerning taste. But things aren’t only picking up in Europe and the US. This past March, employees at our store in Ang Mo Kio in Singapore received basic training in sewing and alterations, establishing our first in-store repair studio in the country. In April, another repair studio opened at DA Square in Malaysia, with an upcycling studio opening at UNIQLO Taipei. In addition to basic services like mending holes and fixing buttons, these studios have set the bar high with upcycled items made from worn-out UNIQLO products, like recycled cushions, tote bags and card cases.<br>
                  These exciting ways of upcycling clothing are what happens when you blend old-time perspectives and techniques with the values of today. These initiatives have made the circle even wider, brightening our future relationship with clothes.
