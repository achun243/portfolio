          <p class="cover_lead">UNIQLO is proactively adopting responsible rayon, which uses only wood sourced from carefully managed forests and has received third-party certification as the raw material. The cellulose fiber from which rayon is derived is made from plants and wood. Many people are concerned about the possible impact on endangered forests and the habitats of endangered animals when procuring the raw materials, as well as potential involvement in illegal logging or infringement of the rights of indigenous peoples. Fast Retailing has created a list of recommended factories for the production of cellulose fiber raw materials based on third-party evaluations, and is pursuing various initiatives to encourage suppliers to source from those recommended factories.</p>

            <p class="canopy_lead">We select recommended factories for sourcing cellulose fiber based on the HOT BUTTON REPORT produced by international forest conservation NGO, Canopy. Canopy has established criteria for assessing viscose producers utilizing cellulosic fibres that concentrates primarily on how the wood is sourced, along with many other factors, and it assesses roughly 30 cellulose fiber producers worldwide. The Hot Button Report also includes chemical assessment information, as developed by ZDHC(Zero Discharge of Hazardous Chemicals).</p>
