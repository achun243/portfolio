                  코로나19는 여성들의 삶에 무거운 그림자를 드리우고 있습니다. 코로나19로 남성에 비해 많은 여성 비정규직 근로자가 실직으로 인한 빈곤에 시달리고 있습니다. 폭력 역시 또 하나의 문제입니다. 일본의 경우, 비상사태 선언으로 외출이 어려웠던 2020년 5~6월에 가정폭력 상담을 요청한 여성이 전년 대비  60% 증가했습니다. 이러한 상황은 일본 뿐만 아니라 전 세계에서 발생하는 문제입니다. 유니클로는 세계 여러 국가에서 NGO와 함께 여성 보호 시설을 지원하고 있습니다.

                        When women lose their job, they can no longer support themselves financially. They may be at risk of domestic violence, or they may lose their precious family. We believe these women need to be able to regain their confidence. We want to use the power of clothing to help them smile again, even if only for a moment. With that aim in mind, UNIQLO has donated innerwear and other clothing items to women living in shelters by enlisting the help of NGOs worldwide. However, in the face of COVID-19, we have grown to believe that is not enough.<br>
                        On March 8, 2021 International Women’s Day, UNIQLO and other Fast Retailing Group brands will present about 10,000 items of clothing such as dresses, cardigans, pants, and bags through the Wakakusa  Project to women who are having to live in shelters. UNIQLO and GU stores in Tokyo and Osaka also hold events where they invite shelter residents to come and choose their favorite clothes as a present. Stylists give the women clothing advice and a professional photographer takes photographs.
                        All of these events are designed to give women the opportunity to regain their independence. UNIQLO will continue to work with various partners to facilitate these initiatives. <br>
                        On March 14, our UNIQLO TOKYO store will invite Wakakusa Project director Atsuko Muraki and NHK producer Kazuyo Fukuda to speak about women’s issues in the wake of COVID-19.

                <p class="section_lead">
                  The Wakakusa Project seeks to help girls and young women who are suffering from various social problems and finding life tough such as poverty, abuse, neglect, domestic violence, bullying, sexual exploitation, drug dependence, or maternity neurosis, and women who have a small SOS in their hearts but don’t know what is causing their suffering. At a glance, Japanese society appears rich. There are many prejudices and misunderstandings about why these women find it difficult to live and the issues they face, so support is often lacking. The Wakakusa Project is an initiative that seeks to bring girls and young women crying out for help together with people who can extend the support that will touch their hearts.
