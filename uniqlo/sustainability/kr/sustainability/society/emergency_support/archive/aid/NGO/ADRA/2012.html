      <h2>Action Plan under Recovery Assistance Project</h2>
      <p>In hard-hit parts of Fukushima Prefecture, high school students who were forced to leave their homes now go to school from their temporary residences. Despite the difficult situation they face, the students remain hopeful. But they will need to acquire new skills to overcome obstacles and stay optimistic about the future.<br>
        ADRA Japan is developing a comprehensive human resources development program for high school students, which is designed to give them the opportunity to broaden their plans for the future. The program is also instilling a sense of self-confidence in students while motivating them to learn and grow.<br>
        Using class time and extracurricular club activities, this program focuses on teaching leadership and entrepreneurial skills while improving communication and problem-solving abilities.<br>
        The program also offers students practical working and learning opportunities. ADRA believes that the first step to recovery is to develop the individual abilities of every student. The organization hopes that, in the future, these students will help with new efforts to develop communities while leading the way for Japan's recovery from the Fukushima nuclear accident.</p>

      <h2>Progress of Activities under Recovery Assistance Project (As of December 31, 2012)</h2>
      <p>In fiscal 2012, ADRA Japan has offered assistance at Namie, Tomioka and Futaba-Shoyo High Schools, which relocated to other parts of Fukushima Prefecture after the nuclear accident. At Namie High School, a UNIQLO store manager gave a speech that touched on his own experiences and the importance of ambition and hope for the future. On a different occasion, the head of Shiseido's Human Resources Development team gave a lecture on human resources and labor demand in Japan, and later held mock interviews with students. Meanwhile, through the Career Options Research Club at Namie High School, ADRA Japan offers students a range of activities aimed at encouraging inventiveness, communication skills and analytic skills.<br>
        Since November 2012, students have been working with Shiseido on activities related to product marketing assignments. Students have discussions with their fellow students and conduct interviews off school premises. In January 2013, students presented their marketing strategies to Shiseido employees. At Tomioka and Futaba-Shoyo High Schools, students have been given the chance to work with UNIQLO on T-shirt designs. The program allows students to experience the company's manufacturing process and acquire the skills they need to do the job. It is also aimed at instilling a sense of accomplishment and self-confidence in students, while empowering them to act.</p>

      <h2>Reports</h2>
      <p>The "My Project," or "Maipro" program, part of Namie High School's Career Options Research Club, gives students the chance to focus on pursuing their interests, while taking concrete steps toward achieving related goals.<br>
        As part of this program, some third-year girls decided to hold a Halloween party for their goal. The biggest challenge they faced was getting permission from the school. But the students created their own proposal, presented it at a faculty meeting and received permission to hold a party on October 31. It was the first time any of the girls had developed a formal proposal for the school. At one point, when the students were on the verge of giving up, they persevered and succeeded.</p>

      <h2>Future Plans</h2>
      <p>In November 2012, high school students from Tomioka and Futaba-Shoyo met with UNIQLO employees for the first time to start their T-shirt development project. Many students said they hope to build confidence in talking to elders and improve their communication skills by participating in the T-shirt project. Others said they wanted to learn about the production and marketing process for clothing. Going forward, the students will decide what to do with the T-shirts after they finish designing and producing them.<br>
        In January 2013, Hilton Tokyo started working with students from Futaba-Shoyo and Namie on a work experience program.</p>
