       <dd class="num"><b>Project aimed at training young people in Fukushima Prefecture</b><br />
        ADRA Japan provided 700 elementary, middle and high school students in Fukushima Prefecture with work experience opportunities. It also held a group workshop and presentation that encouraged people to think critically about the future and act on it. These events gave the students opportunities to interact with young people outside Japan. The aim was to enable the young people to increase their potential and carve out their own future in the face of uncertainty, even though they were living as evacuees. The initiative helped young people to gain confidence and become motivated, while building their potential and broadening their horizons. In spite of their challenging circumstances, many participants still have a positive outlook. Even now, they are actively working to realize their dreams.</dd>

        Technology to limit cesium absorption and a testing program had been established as early as 2011, and empirical testing had already begun in 2012. However, news of such initiatives in Fukushima Prefecture had not reached Tokyo. As a result, ADRA Japan and a Tokyo-based private radiation measurement facility began checking on these initiatives in Fukushima and sharing information. They created a website, measured cesium levels and held workshops in Fukushima and surrounding prefectures. They then summarized these workshops and shared them online. They also published and distributed a pamphlet and a comic book, Hakaru, Shiru, Kurasu [Measure, Understand, Live].</dd>

      <h2>Changes and memorable moments in three years of assistance</h2>
      <dl class="NGO2013">

       <dd class="num"><b>Project aimed at training young people in Fukushima Prefecture</b><br />
        In 2012, a second year student at Namie High School revealed that he dreamed of becoming a hairstylist even though he was shy. His goal was to "acquire the communication skills that hairstylists need and become able to speak to people whom he had just met." Through ADRA Japan's initiative, he overcame his reluctance to speak in front of others and developed the ability to express himself with confidence. He eventually grew as a person to the point that he was able to deliver a moving address as the head of the student council when he graduated.<br>
        His parents used to operate a hair salon in the town of Namie, but they lost their business when the 2011 disaster and consequent nuclear accident forced people to evacuate to the city of Fukushima. After graduating from high school, he enrolled at a hairdressing school. He is working hard to achieve his dream of reopening his family's hair salon. When ADRA Japan caught up with him in December 2014, he said, "I took part in a national hairdressing competition. I was the first hairstylist from Fukushima to represent the Tohoku region at the contest. Although I ultimately lost, my goal is to win a national competition." His efforts and outlook were reminders that people can persevere and hope for a better tomorrow if they have dreams and goals, in spite of the disaster and the reality of life as an evacuee.</dd>

        Radiation levels in parts of Fukushima Prefecture vary due to the extent of decontamination as well as the quality of the soil, the nature of the environment and geography. This is also changing with time. Consequently, the local residents are using advance Geiger counters to monitor radiation after receiving recommendations from specialists to continuously monitor the situation.<br>
        ADRA Japan published Hakaru, Shiru, Kurasu, a booklet that looks at how to live with radiation, because many residents are understandably concerned about living in such an environment. The booklet was well received by many residents of Fukushima Prefecture. They said it was easy to understand and praised it for its neutral viewpoint.</dd>
