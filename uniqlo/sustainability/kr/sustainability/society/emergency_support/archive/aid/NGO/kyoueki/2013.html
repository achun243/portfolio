     <h2>Determination</h2>
     <p class="NGO2013">We believe the capital assistance efforts based on the philosophy of common-benefit investment that we set out to implement from the beginning have been successful. We'll try to implement our second wave of capital assistance by enhancing the value of existing aid sites. In doing so, we intend to continue our support of reconstruction endeavors. Additionally, by reviewing investments and sharing those results with other parties, we will develop a funding model and expand the social impact of capital assistance efforts in the future.</p>
