    <div class="section section_m">
    <p class="mb15">2020년 2월, 유니클로와 GU 직원 9명이 고객이 기부한 리사이클 의류를 난민들에게 전달하고 이들이 받고 있는 지원에 대해 알아보기 위해 말라위 공화국을 방문했습니다. 이는 패스트리테일링이 유엔난민기구(UNHCR)와 맺은 오랜 글로벌 파트너십의 일환입니다. 내부 모집을 통해 선발된 참가자들은 일본에서 비행기로 약 30시간 거리에 있는 '아프리카의 따뜻한 심장'이라고 불리는 동아프리카 내륙국인 말라위로 향했습니다. 이 보고서는 그들의 현장 방문을 기록하고 난민들이 직면한 어려움에 대해 조명합니다.</p>

Nonetheless, the camp was so neat and tidy that it was difficult to believe it was so overcrowded. The refugees were taking care of the property with great respect and, there was little refuse visible.Refugees from the Democratic Republic of the Congo accounted for 60% of the camp’s population, with others coming from Burundi, Rwanda, and Somalia.

Coordination and adjustment by UNHCR were subsequently necessary for safety and security reasons, and this led to a visit several hours behind   schedule. The demonstration was apparently organized because the refugees were informed about   shifting from in-kind to cash assistance but they feel what they got would not be able to cover their needs. The UNHCR explained that support to refugees had been shifted from goods to cash globally, due to the greater flexibility of cash for the beneficiaries. For example, the refugees could use the cash as saving or buy what they truly need. However, due to a chronic shortage of funding, the team learned that the support would not have had reached to satisfy the refugees."><img src="/kr/sustainability/society/refugees/clothing_support/archive/photo/malawi/img/200618_malawi_thumb-09.jpg" width="163" height="111" alt="thumbnail" /></a></p>

With just another room to sleep in, the whole space seemed to be quite cramped for a family of seven. Water was boiling in the kitchen, but there were no foods at a glance."><img src="/kr/sustainability/society/refugees/clothing_support/archive/photo/malawi/img/200618_malawi_thumb-23.jpg" width="163" height="111" alt="thumbnail" /></a></p>

About 40% of its visitors are refugees, with local Malawians making up the remaining 60%. All received medical care free of charge. The obstetrics ward is apparently seeing 150 births every month (a lot!). Because there are only four beds, it is normal for mothers to be discharged 24 hours after birth. There is a plan to upgrade it into a hospital to accept more mothers and patients.

It was located slightly away from the refugee camp and was built through support from UNHCR.The local Malawians and the refugees are operating it together to cultivate nearby fields. The cultivation has been so successful - the harvest has become more than three times  before, and the area becomes one of Malawi’s top producers of tomatoes. Within the camp, chicken and pigs are being raised, and several varieties of vegetables are being cultivated. The farmed vegetables and eggs are apparently being delivered to hotels in Lilongwe, the nation’s capital."><img src="/kr/sustainability/society/refugees/clothing_support/archive/photo/malawi/img/200618_malawi_thumb-27.jpg" width="163" height="111" alt="thumbnail" /></a></p>

About 70 students were tightly but neatly seated together. The children of Dzaleka Refugee Camp learn the education curriculum of the Government of Malawi in English. The students showed us their notebooks that they had neatly taken in this livestock class. After the greetings, the team taught them how to fold paper cranes with the origami that the team had brought from Japan."><img src="/kr/sustainability/society/refugees/clothing_support/archive/photo/malawi/img/200618_malawi_thumb-28.jpg" width="163" height="111" alt="thumbnail" /></a></p>
